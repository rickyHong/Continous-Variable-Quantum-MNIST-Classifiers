# Continous Variable Quantum MNIST Classifiers
## Classical and quantum hybrid circuits for classifying MNIST

This family of MNIST classifiers are classicial-quantum hybrid circuits using Keras and Pennylane. The quantum circuit is composed of a data encoding circuit and quantum neural network circuit as proposed in \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06871v1.pdf}{"Continuous variable quantum neural networks."}
