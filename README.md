# Continous-Variable-Quantum-MNIST-Classifiers
Classical and quantum hybrid circuits for classifying MNIST

This family of MNIST classifiers are classicial-quantum hybrid circuits using Keras and Pennylane. The quantum circuit is composed of a data encoding circuit and quantum neural network circuit as proposed in "Continuous variable quantum neural networks."
